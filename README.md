## About the project

My project is a product management system developed using PHP language and Laravel framework. To enhance its functionality, I have integrated a few libraries, such as Filament PHP, Laravel Breeze, Laravel Permission, and Blade UI Kit. Additionally, I have used images from the website [Irasutoya ](https://www.irasutoya.com/) to make the user interface more visually appealing. The system allows users to manage products efficiently, with features such as adding, updating, and deleting products, as well as assigning categories and tags. With a user-friendly interface and robust functionalities, my product management system is designed to simplify product management tasks for businesses.
